The project is to develop a website that will allow users to recycle their trash with maximum efficiency. The website will allow users to register profiles and give them the ability to ping their location whenever they have a substantial amount of recyclables. It will also allow users to respond to the pinged location, indicating that they will be picking up the recyclables.
